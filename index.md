We want to make the process of leaving an abusive situation as easy as possible, as we are aware that leaving a situation like that is extremely hard on an individual. By helping to make the transition as easy as possible for the client, we are helping to ensure their safety and wellbeing. When a client is discharged from our facility, they’ll be able to safely obtain housing, employment/financial security and receive counselling to deal with the trauma of being a victim of abuse.</p>
    <p>We will have a team of professionals and volunteers to help us provide the best possible care to our clients. Our team of professionals will include; SW and SSW’s for counselling, ECE’s for child care, Financial advisors, and a secured building for protection. There will also be volunteer staff to help with things such as cleaning duties, and kitchen duties. Our objective is to lessen the number of females who are suffering in abusive relationships that feel they cannot leave.

    <h2>Becoming a Volunteer</h2>
    <p>“Volunteering is the most fundamental act of citizenship and philanthropy in our society. Its offering time, energy and skills of one’s own free will. It is an extension of being a good neighbour, transforming a collection of houses into a community, as people become involved in the improvement of their surroundings and choose to help others. By caring and contributing to change, volunteers decrease suffering and disparity, while they gain skills, self-esteem and change in their lives. People work to improve the lives of their neighbours and, in return, enhance their own lives” - Volunteer Ontario, 1996</p>
